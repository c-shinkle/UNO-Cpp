# UNO!

## A pet project inspired by the Mattel classic of the same name. 

### Building

CMake build scripts and project layout inspired by [this blog.](https://www.andygibson.net/blog/programming/from-java-to-c-project-setup/)

To run:

```
cd build
cmake ..
make
./helloworld/helloWorld
```

### Fine Print

For Windows users, I would recommend installing [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/). It will allow you to run `make` and `helloWorld` just as any Unix enviornment can.
